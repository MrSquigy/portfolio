                I will shortly<b><sup>*</sup></b> have a BSc in Computing from the <a href="https://www.unisa.ac.za" target="_blank">University of South Africa</a>. This degree
                is a joint between Computer Science and Information Systems, which means I had subjects such as computer
                architecture, advanced programming, and systems development.
