            I will shortly<b><sup>*</sup></b> have a BSc in Computing from the <a href="https://www.unisa.ac.za" target="_blank">University of South Africa</a>. This degree
            is a joint between Computer Science and Information Systems, which means I had subjects such as computer
            architecture, advanced programming, and systems development.
        </p>

            A complete list of my subjects is provided below. If you would like an official list of my subjects from my
            university, please contact me through twitter or email.
